# Marked by Roxanne - Website Themes

This repository contains three different website themes for the tattoo artist "Marked by Roxanne". Each theme is in its own directory and can be used as a standalone website.

## Themes

1.  **`theme-minimalist`**: A clean, modern, and professional design with a focus on typography and white space.
2.  **`theme-dark`**: A bold, edgy, and modern design with a dark color scheme and vibrant accent colors.
3.  **`theme-artistic`**: A creative and elegant design with unique fonts and a warm, artistic color palette.

## How to Use with GitHub Pages

You can easily deploy any of these themes using GitHub Pages.

1.  **Choose a theme**: Decide which of the three themes you want to use (e.g., `theme-dark`).
2.  **Copy files to root**: Copy the `index.html` and `style.css` files from your chosen theme's directory (e.g., `theme-dark/`) into the main (root) directory of this project.
3.  **Update the image path in `index.html`**: After copying `index.html` to the root directory, you must edit it. Change the image path to correctly point to the services flyer.
    *   **Find this line:** `<img src="../pics/Black & White Elegant Aesthetic Wedding Price List Flyer.png" ...>`
    *   **Change it to:** `<img src="pics/Black & White Elegant Aesthetic Wedding Price List Flyer.png" ...>`
    (You are removing `../` from the path).
4.  **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push the `index.html`, `style.css`, and the `pics` folder to your GitHub repository.
5.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Click on the "Settings" tab.
    *   In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".
    *   Under "Build and deployment", for the "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
    *   Select the branch you pushed your code to (usually `main` or `master`).
    *   Choose `/ (root)` as the folder.
    *   Click "Save".

Your website should be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/` within a few minutes.

## Important: Update Placeholders

Before you go live, make sure to update the following placeholder content in your `index.html` file:

*   **Location**: In the "Location & Hours" section, replace `[Your Address Here], City, State, Zip` with the actual studio address.
*   **Photo Gallery**: The gallery section is currently a placeholder. You will need to add your own photos here.
*   **About the Artist**: Add content to the "About the Artist: Roxanne Wright" section.
